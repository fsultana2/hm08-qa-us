# Sprint 8 project
# project name: hm08-qa-us
# Project description:
    - Setting the Address
        Ensure that the user can set the pick-up and drop-off addresses.
    - Selecting the Supportive Plan
        Verify that the user can select the Supportive Plan option.
    - Filling in the Phone Number
        Check that the user can enter a valid phone number.
    - Adding a Credit Card
        Test the process of adding a credit card.
        Note: The "link" button becomes active only after the CVV field loses focus. Simulate the user pressing TAB                or 
        clicking elsewhere on the screen to change focus.
    - Writing a Message for the Driver
        Confirm that the user can write and submit a message for the driver.
    - Ordering a Blanket and Handkerchiefs
        Ensure that the user can order a blanket and handkerchiefs.
        Note: Use two selectorsâ€”one to click and one to verify that the state changed.
    - Ordering 2 Ice Creams
        Verify that the user can successfully order two ice creams.
    - Car Search Modal
        Check that the car search modal appears after placing the order.
    - Waiting for the Driver Info to Appear in the Modal 
        Optionally, check that the driver's information appears in the modal. This step is more challenging and     
        provides good 
        ractice for tackling complex tasks.

The tests are implemented using Node.js and WebDriverIO and are located in the createAnOrder.e2e.js file within the test/specs folder.

# Constants and Dependencies
    javascript

    const page = require('../../page');
    const helper = require('../../helper');
